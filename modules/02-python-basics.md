# 02 Python Fundamentals â€“ Quick Guide

## ğŸ“˜ Why This Matters

Before diving deep into AI, data science, or web development, it's essential to understand the **fundamentals of Python**. They are the foundation upon which all advanced work is built.

This is not meant to teach you everything at once â€” rather, it's a **quick lookup and orientation** guide to remind you of the core topics you'll need, especially early on.

You'll revisit and master these topics as you build projects and explore more complex problems.

## ğŸ§­ Python Concepts to Know

Hereâ€™s a short list of **fundamental concepts** to get familiar with early on:

- Variables & data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, etc.)
- Control flow: `if`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`
- Functions & arguments (`def`, `return`, `*args`, `**kwargs`)
- Modules & imports
- Error handling with `try`, `except`
- File I/O (`open`, `read`, `write`)
- Classes & Object-Oriented Programming (`class`, `__init__`, `self`)
- List comprehensions and lambda functions
- Working with libraries (e.g., `import numpy as np`)

> ğŸ’¡ You donâ€™t have to memorize everything â€” focus on **understanding and practicing**.
